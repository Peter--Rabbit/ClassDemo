// 2. Create the main method of your program.
// This is the first method that is called 
// whenever you run the program.

// 3. Create a new class called Vehicle.
// Once the class is created, go to it 
// for the next step.

/******************************************************
 * 4. A class is like a template or a blue-print.   		             *
 * You can make many objects from a single class.    		             *
 * For example, you just created a Vehicle class.     		             *
 * Soon you will make many different types of Vehicles	             *
 * from this one class.                           			             *

/******************************************
 * A class's field variables go right below where             *
 * class is declared.  We should mak them private so     *
 * that no other class can access them and mess up      *
 * our program.  			                      *
 ******************************************/
	
// 5. Create a String variable called type.
	
// 6. Create an int variable called wheels.
	
// 7. Create a boolean variable called isFast.
	
// 8. Create the constructor for the Vehicle class.
// The arguments will need to be a String an int
// and a boolean for the three variables we just 
// created

/******************************************************************
 * A constructor is a method that gets called automatically			   *
 * every time an object is created from this class. The constructor                                     *
 * method should contain any basic instructions that every object                                    *
 * needs to operate.  For example, if cooking dinner was a Class, then a constructer       *
 * might contain instructions to get all the ingredients together.  You can't cook             *
 * dinner without the right ingredients, so it would make sense to make sure they           *
 * are all in order before you start cooking.  The arguments that a constructor takes      *
 * are passed in when the object is created			                      *
 ******************************************************************/
		
// 9. Set the type variable equal to the String variable that was
// passed into the constructor.
		
// 10. Set the wheels variable equal to the int variable.
		
// 11. Set isFast equal to the boolean passed in.
	
/***********************************************************
* 12. We are now going to create methods that allow other                                  *
* classes to access the fields we already created.  We make		      *
* them public so that other classes can access these      		      *
* methods. This makes our programs more secure and less  		      *
* likely to have bugs.                                   				      *
************************************************************/

/***********************************************
 * A method is a list of instructions that you can create           *
 * and access any time you want.  It's like doing a task            *
 * once and being able to get the benefits of that task             *
 * any time you want.  Imagine you had a robot. The               *
 * robot watched you clean your room one time.  Then            *
 * from that day on, the robot cleans your room for you           *
 * exactly how you showed him.  That would be cool, huh?     *
 * A method acts like our room-cleaning robot.  We show         *
 * it what to do one time, and then we can call that method      *
 * any time we want to have it complete our task for us.            *
************************************************/

// 13. Create a method called getType that returns a String.  
// Have it return the type variable.
	
// 14. Create a method that returns an int called getWheels.
// Have it return wheels.

// 15. Create a method called getIsFast that returns a boolean
// Have it return isFast.
	
// 16. Return to the main method for the next step

// 17. Let's create some vehicles!
// Create 2 new variables of the Vehicle 
// class called motorcycle, and boat.
		
// 18. Create a 3rd variable for a vehicle
// of your choice.
		
/***************************************************
 * 19. We will now instantiate the vehicles.  We do		      *
 * this by telling java that or motorcycle, boat,  		      *
 * and other vehicle are to be "new" Vehicles.  We 		      *
 * also need to pass in a String, int, and boolean 		      *
 * value so that the Vehicle class can assign them 		      *
 * to our vehicles using the constructor.    		      *
 ***************************************************/
		
/*****************************************************
 * 20. We just created three objects of vehicles         		           *
 * all with different values.  In the Vehicle         		           *
 * class, we only had to create one set of variables,		           *
 * but we can create as many objects that use those  	           *
 * variables as we want.  We will now use those      		           *
 * methods we created in the Vehicle class to access 		           *
 * the information for each vehicle object.          		           *
